# Task_1
This is the first task of Internship where we were assigned to clean and process on a dataset.
<br>
This project cleans and prepares the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset from Kaggle using Excel. Tasks include removing duplicates, fixing missing values, standardizing text columns, and converting date_added to proper date format. The cleaned dataset is ready for analysis or visualization in tools like Excel, Python, or Power BI.
